# Introduction

This little project is just a way to get some fun coding algorithms 
and get used to frameworks. Nothing fancy and still pretty raw, not really properly refactored.

The current aim is to play with Lenia, an Artificial Life algorithm.

# State of the art

A video is on its way to just present more easily what it does without having to download the project
and setting it up.

# Contribution

For those who want to play with it and/or develop on top of it, here are my recommended steps and the minimal configuration:

I only compiled it on windows x64. (Linux on its way, maybe...). I am using Visual Studio 2022.

Make sure cmake is installed and that you can compile c++.

- Install **VCPKG**:
	Follow these steps: https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html
	
- Using **VCPKG**, you'll need:
	1. Qt5:x64-windows (very long...)
	2. SFML:x64-windows
	3. Boost:x64-windows 

Launch the project, compile it all and you should be good to go.
